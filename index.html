<div id='instructions'>This tool generates a random route through Grim Dawn to make leveling new characters less repetitive. It assumes you have unlocked Merits for higher difficulties, making all riftgates accessible from the start. You can print, save or screenshot this page to keep a copy of it or reload to generate a new random route. All DLC for the game may be used in the route.</div>
